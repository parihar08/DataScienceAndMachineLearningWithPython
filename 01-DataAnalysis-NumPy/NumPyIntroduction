NumPy is a Linear Algebra Library for Python. Almost all of the libraries in the PyData
ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks

NumPy is incredibly fast as it has bindings to C libraries

pip3 install numpy

NumPy arrays are the main way we use NumPy

NumPy arrays essentially comes in 2 flavours: Vectors and Matrices

Vectors are strictly 1-D arrays and Matrices are 2-D

(Matrices can only have one row or one column)
